# japan-projects
 Projects created in Unity during my Study Abroad in Tokyo.
 This simulation shows the main street of Kagurazaka in Tokyo and the restaurants. Each customer will have a party of friends that they would like to enter the restaurant with, if the restaurant is full the customers will wait until the other customers leave. The simulation shows that the option where customers will leave to go to another restaurant results in less angry customers and less time to go home. Angry customers are marked by the color red and will return immediately to a train station and green customers are happy and will return home.
